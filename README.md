## The Game: 
Two players are presented with a 6x6 grid of empty slots. The players take turns dropping colored 
tiles into an empty slot; the first to move uses red tiles and the second player uses white. The first player to drop four consecutively placed tiles in a row, column, or diagonal line, wins. If all slots are filled and neither player has a winning set, then the game results in a tie.
